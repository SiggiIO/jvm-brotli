<h1 class="no-margin-top">A lightweight REST API library</h1>

Javalin is a true micro Java REST API library and has very few dependencies:
the embedded web-server (jetty), a logging facade (slf4j-api), and brotli compression.
It also has plugins for JSON mapping, template rendering, and OpenAPI (Swagger), but they're
optional dependencies that you have to add manually.

## Download Javalin
